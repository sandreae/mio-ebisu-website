It has been not so difficult to find a studio in London than I expected. I had to have a studio before I graduate Wimbledon to continue to work without any blank even this will effect financially,,,.This is same as everywhere, it is hard to let people know who I am in the place where I don’t know anybody. In some places, I am asked to take a criminal closure to proof I am not a criminal. 

One of my friend who is a musician had a studio before through SET which is a an art organization for providing affordable studios to artists. An amazing policy they have is “first come, first served” basis. 

I contacted SET for a viewing. 

The viewing happened in few days after I contacted them. It is near Lewisham station. The studio space was used to be a baby products chain store “Mothercare”. There are still few massive photos of baby hanging on the wall.

I really like this project space and studio. I always wanted to have a studio in a warehouse!!

We have decided to take the unit of 367sqf for £440 a month. For complete the procedure, we went to get a signed document by solicitors for "we are not going to squat this studio, when a landlord say get out, we leave immediately without questioning" something like this. 

In Berlin, tenants are well protected by a law to have a strong right as close as what a landlord has which is great. Landlords can’t increase rent fee without renovation, so if tenants have never left the apartment, rent fee stays the same. This makes it hard to find an apartment with a proper contract there, but once you have it, you are secured. 

Inside the space was just empty, no walls, no divisions, there is only masking tape draws borders for each unit on the floor. We need to build wall, and music studio. 


SET gave a good Facebook group called SET (coincidence) which is a community of stage prop. They share used setting equipment for selling, giving shar or needs. There are lots of used materials on sale for cheap price, so we got the main wall materials from the community. Price was 1/5 than the original price. 


15-22th June this project space will be used by participants from 'antiuniversity' festival.

I am organizing a group exhibition in the first weekend of October at the project space. I will exhibit the paintings I didn’t show at the degree show.

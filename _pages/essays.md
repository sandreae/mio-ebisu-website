# Studio Hunt 

Studio is not just workshop space

​

Having a studio is an essential for artist to keep making own works. If you live in a big house with empty space or room, you could make my works at home. This is the most cheapest way and easiest. Studio are not just for making your own works, also making and joining a community. Studio will have their identities. It will show your direct creative process with a certain atmosphere in public. I stayed artist residency/7 selected artists shared studio apartment in Oita Japan for a year. This is supported by art organization who runs a triennale, other art projects collaborated with the city. This year they invided Anish Kapoor to built his new works in a local park. Compared to Anish, my residency place is old traditional Japanese wooden built apartment without air conditioning, old Japanese toilet style (but public hot spring bath is more than 100. This time was the most luxury time in my life so far ) . I had two rooms one for living, one for workshop. This place is caught attention by local people who don't know anything about art, because they think we are just crazy and interesting. I could have exhibitions anytime I want. If I decide to do it, I could get visitors and audiences easily. Because we were in the local community. Also. this place is in a country side of Japan, when the art organization showed the city around to their invited artists, musicians, curators, they visited our crazy apartment. This is sort of an sightseeing spot. I could built my art network not just with visual artists as well as musicians, directors, performers, designers who I could have not be able to meet if I worked only inside my room. Spinneral is an old cotton mill  art studio complex in Leipzig in Germany which is famous for artists from "New Leipzig School" set up their studio around in here. [...]open to new ideas and appreciated the requirements of young, creative people needing exceptional spaces to rent at a reasonable price. (Spinnerei website, http://www.spinnerei.de/from-cotton-to-culture-150.html). This gave Spinnerei associated with art and new identities of the site. One studio can lead city's art scene as well as attention in worldwide. The potential of art studio is enormous. Studios are not just a place to make art works also make creative networks.

Research providers in London  

 

Online must be the best way for the studio hunt. I visited all website listed on my UAL at first. One of them “Acava” seems have many currently available studios both inside London also outside. I tried to register for a viewing, but I need couple of more documents to be prepared so I haven't done it yet (07.Jan.2019). I like this small barrier, they care who would rent, not just how much you can pay bias. There are some  in Deptford where I am interested in for really reasonable rent price for the large space. This is pretty good. Why I am interested in Deptford is that  I saw their annual independent artist-led  festival "Deptford X" information in last September. Unfortunately, when I saw the information the event had already finished, so I didn't see it in a real time. According to their website, the festival was 19th last year. This is pretty amazing to have being carrying on such a long time as a self- organized community. This gives me a good impression.  

​

 Studio provided by "Bow arts" is fascinating too, because of their big networks. They organize education programs, projects space, residencies etc,. Their procedure seems serious too. They want only creative people who work hard and work hard on community as well. This must bring a nice energy to avoid studios become storage.

​

Artist’s Studio Finder by London’s artist quarter & Kent creative workspace has a list of available studio in London and Kent. Acava has a studio complex in Stoke-on-Trent where is near Manchester. It sounds crazy, but actually Stoke is just an hour away from London Euston by train within few stops. I am interested in pottery now. This is the place of Wedgewood. They must be many ceramic studios too. This is not that bad idea.

​

After looking through those websites, I am relieved from the hopeless of having affordable studios in London (outside too). There are more possibilities than I expected and more opportunities to be in an art network after graduation by renting and working in the studios. My ideal is owning or renting abandoned space with my friends and renovate together to make a new art complex. Platform for an experiment, spontaneous or immediate and long-term researching projects somewhe

It has been not so difficult to find a studio in London than I expected. I had to have a studio before I graduate Wimbledon to continue to work without any blank even this will effect financially,,,.This is same as everywhere, it is hard to let people know who I am in the place where I don’t know anybody. In some places, I am asked to take a criminal closure to proof I am not a criminal. 

One of my friend who is a musician had a studio before through SET which is a an art organization for providing affordable studios to artists. An amazing policy they have is “first come, first served” basis. 

I contacted SET for a viewing. 

The viewing happened in few days after I contacted them. It is near Lewisham station. The studio space was used to be a baby products chain store “Mothercare”. There are still few massive photos of baby hanging on the wall.

I really like this project space and studio. I always wanted to have a studio in a warehouse!!

We have decided to take the unit of 367sqf for £440 a month. For complete the procedure, we went to get a signed document by solicitors for "we are not going to squat this studio, when a landlord say get out, we leave immediately without questioning" something like this. 

In Berlin, tenants are well protected by a law to have a strong right as close as what a landlord has which is great. Landlords can’t increase rent fee without renovation, so if tenants have never left the apartment, rent fee stays the same. This makes it hard to find an apartment with a proper contract there, but once you have it, you are secured. 

Inside the space was just empty, no walls, no divisions, there is only masking tape draws borders for each unit on the floor. We need to build wall, and music studio. 


SET gave a good Facebook group called SET (coincidence) which is a community of stage prop. They share used setting equipment for selling, giving shar or needs. There are lots of used materials on sale for cheap price, so we got the main wall materials from the community. Price was 1/5 than the original price. 


15-22th June this project space will be used by participants from 'antiuniversity' festival.
http://www.antiuniversity.org/

ANTIUNIVERSITY NOW IS A COLLABORATIVE EXPERIMENT TO REIMAGINE THE 1968 ANTIUNIVERSITY OF LONDON IN AN ONGOING PROGRAMME OF FREE AND INCLUSIVE SELF-ORGANISED RADICAL LEARNING AND MUTUAL EDUCATION EVENTS.
ANTIUNIVERSITY NOW CHALLENGES ACADEMIC AND CLASS HIERARCHY THROUGH AN OPEN INVITATION TO TEACH AND LEARN ANY SUBJECT, IN ANY FORM, ANYWHERE.

I am organizing a group exhibition in the first weekend of October at the project space. I will exhibit the paintings I didn’t show at the degree show. 







# After graduate

I have a solo exhibition at the gallery I am represented in Tokyo in next January. I might organize a group exhibition in the project space in my studio. After graduate, I will apply prizes especially John Moore Painting Prize. My income from painting is mainly from the gallery in Tokyo. Such an emerging artists like me, I have few collectors buy my works regularly which is miracle.  One of them Okada-san, he is on the book I read for research as an important collector in Japanese contemporary art scene, he is a super nice guy….This is a good thing in Japanese art scene, contemporary art is new, not established, there are people want to support artists  to help the small Japanese art scene. On the contrary, here is different, art is main stream, and established. Tons of artists are produced each year, helps the art world busy and competitive. 

However, many countries in Europe has an amazing funding (Japan is rubbish in this field). In Berlin, there are lots of different funds you can apply if you live there, no matter your nationalities. Many alternative spaces are funded by Berlin city, so director/artist can get pay yourself by organizing space. Even though UK government cut the budged on culture, I thnk a system of Arts council England is amazing. You can apply 4 times a year, which you can try many times until you get it! I worked with British musicians to have events in Japan, they applied the funding and luckily, we got it, it allowed me organize events in Japan and get paid. Japanese art funding opens for university or big organization, it is almost impossible for individual artist get it. Public funding is so important factor for artists for survive this society, also great for society with full of culture, and happening. 



# Chinese Van Gogh 

I loved the film, I watched twice after the film screening. This documentary is about a city has a big industry to create fake master piece paintings in China. Workers are producing fake western classical master pieces everyday. The one of the painter of the city who has never seen the real Van Gogh’s paintings in real goes to Netherland to see the original works and visits the store he is working for. 

Business can only survive if there are people who buy their products or services, this is pretty surprised there are many people who buy the fake Van Gogh’s paintings. 



During the journey, he started questioning his own style to express himself in painting. He didn't make any clear answer, but he has started to draw his picture.



There are some questions come up in this documentary, such as from " is he an artis?" " should artists have own expressioin?" "What is the value of fake art?" to the current map of inequality between Chinese labor and other international countries which makes a profit from using low wage workers.  


My main wonder was " How can it be a successful business? " It means there are many people who buy fake paintings?  


In the documentary, the price of those paintings is not as cheap as I expected. They are around 800 €. 
This is not cheap. I thought they would be similar to printed canvases at IKEA. I prejudiced that people who buy these paintings tend to buy those fake paintings, they don't care much about art, so 800€ sounds a big commitment. 




When the main character visited the shop which sells his paintings. He was quite shocked. Because they are not fancy than his expected. The shop is actually a souvenir shop, piles of unstretched canvases are hung from the ceiling to walls. They are shocked because their paintings are not treated as art. 


The replica business reminds me of a wax museum "Madame Tussauds". 

I was surprised by the long queue in front of the one in London from the bus I was in. I assumed they are all tourists,  there are many things to see in London, and even though the top quality museum is free to enter. Why there are many people want go to a wax museum with a high entrance fee?!

Madame Tussauds opens 26 places all over the world which tells how people are interested in celebrities. 

However, people who go to Madame Tussauds must be aware of the wiredness that they can take pictures together, and it could be super  “kitsch”. Wax dolls are everybody you know well from TV, magazines but you have never met them in person. You will definitely have an exciting time because you know them. You are not sure what would be, you know what it is what you can get.  Entertainment is a safe place and secure. There is no time you encounter something you don't know which is not fun. 

Intervening in something that you know and are well known to others may satisfy your desire for approval by other people. For those who buy spurious Van Gogh pictures,  billions of money would cost, now it is available at 800 €, what a bargain.  People tend to be sweetened to what they know.
